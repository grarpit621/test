                        <p>The Professor, real name Sergio, mostly grew up in hospitals due to being 
                            a sick child. He leads the gang, and is the one who carefully plans and 
                            organises the heist in the Royal Mint and the Bank of Spain. He is sophisticated 
                            but nerdy.
                            Early in development, the Professor was intended to be the narrator of the series
                            Writer Javier Gómez Santander compared the writing process to the Professor's 
                            way of thinking, "going around, writing down options, consulting engineers whom 
                            you cannot tell why you ask them that", but noted that fiction allowed the police 
                            to be written as dumber or more inept when necessary.</p>
